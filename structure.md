2. small: in collaboration with : nice logos
3. Our bikes
    - Textual description - see "story doc" or current index.html
    - list or carousel of [image + title + small textual description]
4. FAQ
    - Accordion of questions (see index.html of old template)
    - Tapping "Will Pandas be mad?" extends the short answer
5. For retailers:
    - Short description that retailers can gen in touch to have exclusive deals bla bla. Text to be done
6. Get in touch/Order
    - for now simple links to FB page
    - `I want one` order button which is a glorified "mailto:..." link. Maybe this should be visible at all times ?

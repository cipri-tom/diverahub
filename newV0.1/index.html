                  <div >
                    <p class="text-left">Bamboo   is one of the most   important nature’s substitute for the endangered   rainforest hardwoods.   It is a quick-growing, versatile , non-timber   forest product whose   rate of biomass generation is unsurpassed by any   other plants. With a   10-30 % annual increase in biomass versus 2-5 % for   trees, bamboo   creates greater yields of raw material for use. It is   utilized   extensively for a wide range of purposes. The strength of the   culms,   their straightness, smoothness, lightness combined with hardness   and   greater hollowness; the facility and regularity with which they can   be   split; the different sizes, various lengths and thickness of their     joints make them suitable for numerous end products/purposes. The     versatility of bamboo outmatches most tree species. It is known to be a     natural and excellent raw material for manufacturing strong and sturdy     furniture, handicrafts, and novelty items.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p class="text-left">Bamboos   include some of the   fastest-growing plants in the world, &nbsp;due to a   unique   rhizome-dependent system. Certain species of bamboo can grow 91   cm (36   in) within a 24-hour period, at a rate of almost 4 cm (1.6 in) an     hour (a growth around 1 mm every 90 seconds, or 1 inch every 40     minutes). Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass family.     Bamboos are of notable economic and cultural significance in South Asia,     Southeast Asia and East Asia, being used for building materials, as a     food source, and as a versatile raw product.&nbsp;</p>

                  <div>
                    <p class="text-left">Bamboo   has a higher   specific compression strength than wood, brick, or   concrete and a   specific tensile strength that rivals steel. Like true   wood, is a   natural composite material with a high strength-to-weight   ratio useful   for structures. It has also long been used as scaffolding;   the   practice has been banned in China for buildings over six stories,   but   is still in continuous use for skyscrapers in Hong Kong.<br>
                      Bamboo has been used as reinforcement for   concrete in those areas where   it is plentiful. It does have the   necessary strength to fulfill this   function, but untreated bamboo will   swell with water absorbed from the   concrete, causing it to crack.   Several procedures must be followed to   overcome this shortcoming.</p>
                  <p class="text-left">In Shanghai ´´The Pavilion´´ is the world’s largest bamboo dome, about 34 m (112 ft) in diameter, with bamboo beams/members overlaid with a ferro-concrete slab, waterproofing, copper plate, solar PV panels, a small windmill, and live plants. A total of 30 km (19 mi) of bamboo was used. The dome is supported on 18-m-long steel piles and a series of steel ring beams. The bamboo was treated with borax and boric acid as a fire retardant and insecticide and bent in the required shape. The bamboo sections were joined with reinforcement bars and concrete mortar to achieve the necessary lengths.</p>

			<h2> Stiffer than many carbon fiber frames</h2>
			<p>Several aspects of bamboo are extremely valuable to both cyclists and bicycle manufacturers: high strength-to-weight ratio, vibration control, and sustainable growth. Because of bamboo's tendency to grow straight, it does not exhibit "knots" and "turns" in its wood, unlike other types of wood. As a result, bamboo has a higher specific tensile strength than steel, as well as a higher specific compressive strength than concrete. This tendency also allows for excellent vibration control, which, in turn, provides for a smoother ride and increased stability on rough terrain.</p>
			<p>Low carbon footprint
</p>
			<p>One of the biggest problems today is CO2 emissions that lead to global warming. This phenomenon affects every aspect of every living being on the planet. At DIVERA we combine our passion for art and bicycles while reducing the carbon emissions by making our bikes from ECO friendly materials. 
</p>
			<p>With more than 1500 species, bamboo holds the Guinness World Record for the world’s fastest growing plant. In this respect, bamboo wins hands-down: it grows faster than many trees, growing up to 1.2 meters per day. By using bamboo as a main material for our bikes we not only replace other materials that require high amount of CO2 to produce, but we also prevent deforestation since bamboo grows fast and it rarely needs to be replanted. One hectare (an area roughly the size of an athletics track) of bamboo can store up to 250 tons of carbon (Qi, 2009). Using data on CO2 emissions from the World Bank, this translates into the amount of carbon that was produced in 2009 by around 160 people in China (or, equivalently, 50 people in the U.S.A.).  
</p>
			<p>Is unique. Is a work of art. It feels alive.
</p>
			<p>Using other materials like carbon fibers, aluminium or steel is convenient, easy, fast and they require less hand work. For this reason a bamboo bike an uncommon functional work of art to be seen on the streets. 
</p>
			<p>While it looks all natural and it incorporates pure nature into it´s functional design, is also incredible strong and it dampens vibrations better than any other material. It also has a reduced weigh. All these factors and our carefully calculated frame geometry gives the rider a pleasant feeling of smoothness during the ride.

<ul>
  <li>Q: How much does a DIVERA bamboo bike weight? <br>
</li>
  <li>A: Depending on the frame size, the most of our naked frames weight between 2.7-3.2 Kg (6-7 lbs). When components and equipment are added on the frame, the average weight is about 10 kg (14 lbs). <br>
</li>
  <li>Q: How resistant is the frame to impact or rough terrain? <br>
</li>
  <li>A: Our frames were tested by professional bikers under extreme conditions. As expected, our frames proved they can withstand a lot of abuse, performing extremely well even under those harsh conditions and rough terrain. However, wheels, pedals or other components might be susceptible to damage if used in conditions they were not designed to be used. For example, a slim and thin rim, designed to be used only in the city and on flat roads, might be damaged if used on rough terrain. Same goes for forks and pedals.</li>
  <li>How will the frame resist in time?</li>
  <li>A common problem with most of our competitors frames is that the bamboo tends to split in a few months or years. This can happen for a variety of reasons varying from the type of bamboo used to the way it was processed and treated. At DIVERA we collaborate with world experts in bamboo industry to make sure we choose the best species of bamboo from over 1500 types. Moreover, in order to be sure that our frames will last many years in various climate conditions, the bamboo goes through a series of drying &nbsp;in a controlled manner and environmentally friendly chemical processes. Additionally, after the frames are built and all the joints have dried and hardened, they go through a extra temperature-controlled step, meant to relieve the internal stress of the frame after all the joints are made. All these factors will ensure that our frames will last at least 20 years in any climate (hot or cold, humid or dry) without any structural problems.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>How long is the warranty I get?</li>
  <li>We know our frames will last very good in time therefore we offer 10 Years warranty for our frames. </li>
  <li>But will the bugs eat it? </li>
  <li>Short answer: NO. The frame has a special epoxy coating that will make the bugs uninterested. If the coating is by any chance damaged, then the boric acid (obtained from sasonite; a natural mineral) that is in the fibers will, for sure, keep the bugs and mites away as it is an insecticide. It is non-toxic for humans and we use it in the bamboo drying process. Is like a thing that has to be done.</li>
  <li>So will it burn like a torch if I am going to BBQ and a hot piece of coal will land on it?</li>
  <li>Nope... You could not lit it on fire even if you´ll try. Again is the epoxy coating and the boric acid from the wood that will prevent the bamboo to burn. Boric acid is commonly used in wood industry as flame retardant because of it´s non-toxicity for humans and is also safe for enviroment (except bugs, ants and mites). </li>

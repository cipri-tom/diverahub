Is more than just a bike. Is a life style.

Today, human beings are at the period of the pursuit of happiness more than ever. A good health is the foundation of happiness and the environment is the root of health. At DIVERA we aim to build top quality bikes while maintaining a low carbon footprint and protect the environment by promoting the use of clean and renewable materials. Our hand built bamboo frames are pieced together using hemp fibers and epoxy BIO resins.

Bamboo and the enviroment
As a renewable and sustainable resource, bamboo can coordinate the relationship between human life and natural resources,  and alleviate global warming and natural ecological crises that we all face today. Bamboo can also replace the role of wood or other materials that generate high amount of CO2, thus reducing deforestation and promoting low carbon footprint industry. Taxonomically bamboo is clasifyed as a grass, but it has a strong vitality. With nearly a hundred years of life, it´s roots can extend to an area of a few hundreds kilometers/ha. It therefore does not need to be replanted after harvesting, as it shows a strong regeneration after only one year.

Due to it´s fast growing properties, it can absorb 30% more CO2 than other trees and release 35% more oxygen.

Because of It´s structural characteristics, bamboo has a strong ability of air purification. It also presents great abilities for:

Purification of ammonia - 88-90%

Sterilisation - 90%

Release negative ions: 100/cm3
